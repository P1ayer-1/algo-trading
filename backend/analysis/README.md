# backend/analysis — evaluation and data tooling

Everything here reads recorded data. Nothing here touches the exchange.

Your interpreter:

```
D:\Micromamba\micromambaenv\envs\crypto_bot\python.exe
```

Shortened to `python` below. Run from the repo root.

Only `numpy` is required. `pyarrow`/`duckdb` are optional and only for
`compact.py`.

## check_features.py — does any of this predict anything?

```
python backend\analysis\check_features.py --horizon 5 --cost-bps 6
```

**This is a gate, not a formality.** Run it before writing a line of model
code. If the features carry no out-of-sample information, no amount of
LightGBM will manufacture an edge, and finding out here costs an afternoon
instead of a month.

It reports, in order:

1. **Data summary** — span, sampling rate, label balance, and the *effective*
   sample size.
2. **Information coefficients** — Pearson and Spearman per feature, with
   t-statistics on the effective N.
3. **Leakage checks** — loud, because a leak looks exactly like success.
4. **Out-of-sample test** — time-ordered, purged split; logistic baseline.
5. **Economic test** — the only one that decides anything.

### Three things it does that most home-made checks don't

**Effective sample size.** At 250ms sampling with a 5s horizon, adjacent rows
share 4.75s of their forward window. Twenty consecutive rows are roughly *one*
independent observation. A t-statistic computed on 350,000 rows when the real
N is 17,500 overstates significance by ~4.5x. This is the single most common
way to convince yourself noise is signal, and the script corrects for it
everywhere.

**Purged split.** Never shuffled, and it drops a gap of one horizon between
train and test. Without the gap the last training rows carry labels reaching
forward into the test period, leaking the answer.

**The economic test.** Accuracy is not profitability. A 55%-accurate model
predicting 1bps moves loses money against 6bps of costs, every time. The
script reports mean forward return by predicted-probability decile and
compares the top decile against `--cost-bps`. Set that from your *measured*
round-trip cost.

### Reading the verdict

| Verdict | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `NO SIGNAL` | AUC ≈ 0.5. Don't build a model. Collect more data, try a shorter horizon, or add features. |
| `STATISTICAL SIGNAL, BUT NOT TRADEABLE` | Direction is predictable but moves are smaller than costs. **The most common real outcome** — a genuine result, not a failure. Next step is cheaper execution (maker-only), not a bigger model. |
| `PROMISING` | Worth building properly. Confirm on a *different day* before believing it. |

Calibration: single-feature |IC| of **0.01–0.06** is a realistic, usable
signal at these horizons. |IC| > 0.20 is nearly always a bug, and the script
says so.

The script is tested against data with a deliberately planted edge, against a
realistic weak edge, and against pure noise — a check that can only ever say
"promising" is worse than no check.

## replay.py — rebuild features from the raw archive

```
python backend\analysis\replay.py --date 2026-09-06
python backend\analysis\replay.py --sample-ms 100 --horizons 0.5,2,10 --out data\replayed
```

Regenerates a feature CSV from `data/raw/`, using the **same** `OrderBook`,
`TradeTape` and `FeatureEngine` as the live path — so replayed features are
identical to what the bot computes live (there's a test pinning this).

This is what makes the raw archive worth keeping: add a feature or change a
horizon, replay everything you've ever recorded, and get a new dataset in
minutes instead of waiting days to collect one.

## compact.py — Parquet conversion and storage report

```
python backend\analysis\compact.py --report        # sizes only
python backend\analysis\compact.py                # convert to Parquet
```

**You probably don't need this yet.** CSV plus numpy handles a few million
rows fine. Run it when loading starts to annoy you — past ~10M rows.

Then query with DuckDB, no server required:

```python
import duckdb
duckdb.sql("SELECT AVG(fwd_ret_bps_5s) FROM 'data/parquet/*.parquet' "
           "WHERE obi_1 > 0.5").show()
```

## Storage: measured, not guessed

| What | Per day | Per month | Per year |
|---|---|---|---|
| Raw archive (gzipped) | ~100 MB | ~3 GB | ~37 GB |
| Feature CSV @ 250ms | ~160 MB | ~4.8 GB | ~58 GB |
| **Combined** | **~260 MB** | **~8 GB** | **~95 GB** |

Feature CSV scales linearly with sample rate: 100ms ≈ 400 MB/day, 1s ≈ 40
MB/day. Measured at 461 bytes/row over 40,000 real rows.

### Why files and not a database

The workload is append-only with a single writer, and reads are full
sequential scans for training. There are no updates, no deletes, no
concurrent writers, and no transactions. A relational database would add
operational overhead and ACID guarantees you don't need, while being *slower*
at the full-table scans that are the actual access pattern.

If you want SQL, DuckDB over Parquet gives you it with nothing to install,
run, back up, or keep alive. A real server database (ClickHouse is the right
one for this shape of data) only starts to pay off across many instruments and
billions of rows — worth revisiting then, not now.

### The one rule about deleting things

**The raw archive is irreplaceable. The feature CSVs are not.**

Feature CSVs can be regenerated from raw at any time with `replay.py`, so if
you need space, delete those. Raw events cannot be recovered once gone — that
market moment is over.
